            I am a Computer Technician, graduated from Federal Institute of
            Science and Technology of Amazonas in 2022, where I got to meet
            amazing people and get started with Software Development and Agile
            development by building a project along side two of my best friends.
            I am currently mastering the fundamentals of Software Engineering
            and Web Development from the Back-end.

          My journey starts before the pandemic, at the Federal Institute of
          Science and Technology of Amazonas, where I got to study IT and get
          introduced to programming languages like C, Java, JavaScript and PHP.

          Throughout my career, I've always wanted to screenshot these little
          things that I thought were huge accomplishments, with the idea of
          "documenting life checkpoints". For example, take this screenshot from
          November 14th, 2021, of one of my first HTML pages:
