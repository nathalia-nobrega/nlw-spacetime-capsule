        This is my most personal project yet. I am sharing
        with you my progress so far (May, 2023) as a Software Development
        Student, my dreams and thoughts about how want things to go in the
        future, but most importantly, how they have gone so far. I want to able to look back to this and be proud of myself, be
        proud of my achievements and resilience.
