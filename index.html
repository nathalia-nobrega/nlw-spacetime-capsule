        This is my most personal project yet. I am sharing
        with you my progress so far (May, 2023) as a Software Development
        Student, my dreams and thoughts about how want things to go in the
        future, but most importantly, how they have gone so far. I want to able to look back to this and be proud of myself, be
        proud of my achievements and resilience.

      <p>Throughout my career, I've always wanted to screenshot these little things that I thought were huge accomplishments, with the idea of "documenting life checkpoints". For example, take this screenshot from November 14th, 2021, of one of my first HTML pages: </p>
      <img src="assets/images/first-html.png" alt="An HTML Socials page" class="img-border memory-img">
  
      <span>And the first file that I commited to my GitHub account, also in November, 2021: </span>
